**_welcome to oregon trail files_**

Our project is a simulation of a family's journey along the Oregon Trail. Your family has heard about the riches to be made in Oregon in the 1849's. You start with a certain profession and set out with your family on the Oregon Trail with certain items. During the journey on the trail, many unfortunate happenstances can befall your family. There will be towns along the route which can be places to buy supplies and rest. The goal of the game is to safely make it to Oregon with every member of the family and with as much money as possible. *May the odds be ever in your favor!*
